- Examples from other tools (if applicable)

### Contributing Code

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following our code style guidelines
3. **Write or update tests** to cover your changes
4. **Ensure all tests pass** with `npm test`
5. **Run the linter** with `npm run lint` and fix any issues
6. **Build the extension** with `npm run build` to verify
7. **Commit your changes** using clear, descriptive commit messages
8. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/safesnap.git
cd safesnap

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Build the extension
npm run build

# Watch mode for development
npm run watch
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/ES6+

- Use modern ES6+ syntax (const/let, arrow functions, destructuring)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use async/await instead of Promise chains

### File Organization

- Place source code in `src/`
- Place tests in `tests/` mirroring the source structure
- Place configuration in `config/`
- Keep files focused on a single concern

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Test both success and error cases
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, no logic changes)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring (no feature changes)
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks (dependencies, build config)

Examples:

```
feat: add support for custom PII detection patterns
fix: resolve memory leak in screenshot capture
docs: update installation instructions
test: add unit tests for pattern matcher
```

## Testing Requirements

All pull requests must:

- Pass all existing tests (`npm test`)
- Include tests for new functionality
- Maintain or improve code coverage (>80%)
- Pass ESLint checks (`npm run lint`)
- Build successfully (`npm run build`)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- path/to/test.test.js
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if you're changing functionality
2. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with your changes under "Unreleased"
3. **Ensure CI checks pass** - GitHub Actions will automatically run:
   - **Linting** (`npm run lint`) - Code quality checks
   - **Tests** (`npm test`) - All tests must pass
   - **Build** (`npm run build`) - Extension must build successfully
   - These checks are **required** and PRs cannot be merged until all pass ✅
4. **Request review** from maintainers
5. **Address feedback** and make requested changes
6. **Squash commits** if requested before merge

### GitHub Actions CI

When you create or update a PR, you'll see automated checks running at the bottom of your PR:

- 🟢 Green checkmark = All checks passed (ready to merge)
- 🔴 Red X = Some checks failed (needs fixing)
- 🟡 Yellow dot = Checks are running (please wait)

A bot will also post a comment summarizing the check results. If checks fail, click "Details" to see the error logs.

## Key Architecture Decisions

### PII Detection

- Uses dictionary-based detection with 20K+ proper nouns
- Pattern-based detection for structured data (emails, phones, etc.)
- Custom regex patterns for user-defined sensitive data

### Replacement Strategy

- Consistent replacements within a session (same input = same output)
- Magnitude variance for realistic money/quantity replacements
- Preserves data relationships and format

### Privacy First

- All processing happens locally in the browser
- No data sent to external servers
- No analytics or tracking
- User data stays on their machine
